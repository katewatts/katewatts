- 👋 Hi, I’m @katewatts. I've been a specialist recruiter since 2008 and have recently moved in the tech space.
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with tech talent specifically in South Africa and furthering my self-taught knowledge in the development sphere.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much! Presently investigating Python and dabbling with .bubble
- 💞️ If you're on the market for a new role and tired of working with recruiters who just forward your CV out randomly, give me a try!
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best :) talent@accplace.co.za or WhatsApp 071 875 9356
